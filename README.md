# Vision
Smart Home Voice Assistant using AI inspired by Jarvis

This is Vision, my DIY voice assistant inspired by Iron Manâ€™s AI. Built on a ThinkPad, powered by Python, and running fully offline, this project brings together wake word detection, speech-to-text, command handling, and text-to-speech. My goal is to eventually expand it into a modular smart home interface that runs on low-cost hardware, but with built in AI to give it a personality and memory so its more humanoid than a boring Alexa.
